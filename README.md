# Vulnerability-Detector_Code-Quality-Analyser
This is GUI based Vulnerability Detector and Code Quality Analyzer application which uses machine learning to detect vulnerabilities.
This application can currently detect Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection and Website Prone to Phishing attacks.


# Usage
Once you open the application, you will see the main page, where you can enter the URL of the website you want to scan for vulnerabilities. 
After entering the URL, you need to click on the button corresponding to the vulnerability for which you want to scan.
Make sure you enter the complete URL for better results. For Example:- https://www.example.com/
The application will scan the website and detect if there are any vulnerabilities. 
If vulnerabilities are found, the application will display a message saying 'Vulnerability Detected, Code Quality Illegitimate'.
If not, it will display 'Vulnerability not found, Code Quality Legitimate'.
