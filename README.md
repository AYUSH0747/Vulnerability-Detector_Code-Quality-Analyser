# Vulnerability-Detector_Code-Quality-Analyser
The Vulnerability-Detector and Code-Quality Analyzer is a powerful Python-based tool designed to detect three types of vulnerabilities:
- SQL Injection (SQLIA)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Phishing

Using machine learning algorithms, this tool helps ensure the security and integrity of your code by indentifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Features
- ***Vulnerability Detection:-*** The tool employes machine learning algorithms to identify SQL injection, XSS, and phishing vulnerabilites.
- ***Intuitive User Interface:-*** The tool provides a user-friendly ***Graphical User Interface (GUI)***, enabling smooth execution and clear result presentation.


## Getting Started
To get started with the Vulnerability-Detector and Code-Quality Analyzer, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository or download the source code for the tool.
- Ensure you have a compatible Python environment installed on your system.
- Run the Code
- Enter the _URL_ of the website for which you want to check vulnerabilites.
  >Enter the complete URL.
  >
  >For Example:- https://www.example.com/
  
- Click the button corresponding to the Vulnerability for which you want to check.
- If the vulnerbaility exist then you will get output ***'Vulnerability Detected, Code Quality Illegitimate'***. Else, you will get output ***'Vulnerability not detected, Code Quality Legitimate'***.

## Important Notes
- The Vulnerability-Detector and Code-Quality Analyzer is designed to assist in identifying vulnerabilities and imporving code quality. However, it does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities or flawless code.
- Please use the tool responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
- Keep in mind that effectiveness of vulnerability detection depends on various factors, including the quality of training data and the complexity of the codebase. Regular security audits and manual code reviews are still essential practices.
